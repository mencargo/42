# SSH (~/.ssh)
Generate keys with `ssh-keygen` with optional `-t <algorithm> -b <size>`, default is __\<rsa\>__

Public key should be at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

# GIT (repo/.git)

`git init` initializes a local repository (creates a .git folder with initial config)

`git remote add origin <url>` set's a remote repository url

`git push --set-upstream origin master` will push your staged files to the remote repo

If the repository has already been created remotely, you can just clone it, and it will already have all basic config for a push:

`git clone <url> <new_folder>`

`git commit -a -m "message"` will add and commit ANY modified files that have already been added to the repository

### .gitignore
Useful stuff to ignore in most excercises, use with caution!
```
.*
*.out
*.pdf
```

In most excercises you could include `main.c` and/or `*.sh`

### force stuff:
`git add -f main.c` an excercise that asks for a whole program

`git rm -f <wrong_file>` could be __\<folder\>__ with __-rf__

`git checkout master -f <file>` could be the entire repo without __\<file\>__
 
 `git remote set-url origin <url>` changes an existing remote repository url
 
 Completely messed up a local repo and want to start over? Could try `rm -rf .git` in the root repository folder

### check stuff:
`git status` pay attention to the messages
 
`git log` check that your __HEAD__ is in the same commit as __origin/master__

`git ls-files` list of commited files
 
`git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r <commit-hash>` list of files staged at a specific commit
